## Junior to Senior project at Digipen with Team Lavendeer.

The game was heavily inspired by Super Mario Sunshine. Over the first semester there was much back and forth over the direction and scope we would take it in. This was also our first time working in Unreal so there was a bit of a learning curve there as well. Overall I'm pretty happy with the work we produced but I still feel like we could have done more.

The second semester was where things really started to come together. Most of the mechanics were in and we had our first level. There was some performance issues but it was manageable.

The final semester a bit rougher. We had a complete redesign of the level and a couple new mechanics but Covid really impacted some of our deadlines here. We also started running into a lot of critical bugs that were often difficult to track down. We did complete everything in the end but it was challenging.

Overall I’m pretty happy with what we made. I do still wish we could have done more with it but it really would have been outside the scope of the class.

### What did I work on?

My main role was the lead AI programmer. I worked with the designers to create several behaviors for the pogglewonks.

 Aside from that I worked a bit on performance/optimization, and maintaining our bug list(not having access to more professional software like jira or remedy made this a bit trickier).

### Awards
 Finalist for the Game Development World Championship summer hobby and student awards.
