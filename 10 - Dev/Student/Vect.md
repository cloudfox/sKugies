## What is the game?

This game was more of a top down dungeon crawler experiment. We had very minimal graphics(not surprising considering it was just a bunch of novice programmers on this project)

### What did I work on?

I mainly worked on collision implementing SAT as well as a simple particle system.

Other thoughts This project I believe is what led me to being more interested in making game engine or at least how they work.
