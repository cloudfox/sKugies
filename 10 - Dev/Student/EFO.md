## What is the game?

2d physics based puzzle platformer. Multidisciplinary project.

### What did I work on?

Researched and designed the core engine around using an Entity Component System. Simple tools using IMGUI for level creation and debugging.

### Other thoughts

This was the first major project where we were largely making everything from scratch. The summer before I had already been working on trying to build my own game engine. Taking what I learned and building on that I made the core framework of EFO.

There were definitely parts that I’ve since recocgnized as overly complicated or inefficient. I’m hoping to take what I’ve learned since to give making a game engine another go. One of the biggest problems with this games engine is everything is single threaded. I had some thoughts on areas I could add multi threading(namely some steps of the physics calculation) but as with most of my student projects time and familiarity are limiting factors.

I’ve also learned that programming physics and collision from scratch is tangled nightmare of edge cases. I could probably do a better job of it now but I’m pretty sure I’m just going to stick to existing libraries in this particular area.

Overall I feel kinda neutral about the game. It ended up as a fairly simple platformer without any mechanics to really make it stand out. I did learn a lot during it’s development so that’s really all that matters in the end.
