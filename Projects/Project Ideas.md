1. The spinning dots in a circle that each play a note when they cross the start line
- super simple but kinda fun
- what would it sound like if each dot played another sound when passing by the other dots?

2. random numbers charting values
	- different random number distributions
	- multiple dice, averages, drop highest/lowest, dropping multiple, drop even/odd
	- logs, exponentials
	- how random number gens work
	- even distribution, controlling distribution
	- fudging distributions
	- custom distributions/curves
