My name is Steven Kugies, I'm a game developer based in the greater Seattle area but originally from southern California. Making games has always been a passion of mine. My main areas of interest are in engines, AI , and graphics. I've dabbled in a few other areas as well.

Outside of games I enjoy reading while wishing books didn't take up so much space. I commute by bike when I can and like being near the water. I enjoy making things which outside of games has mostly been cooking.




Some favorite games:
Chrono Trigger, Megaman Legends, Breath of the Wild, Wind Waker, Guild Wars 1, Beat Saber, Elden Ring, Raft, Starcraft 2, Radiata Stories, Paper Mario TTYD
