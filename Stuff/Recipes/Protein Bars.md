### Ingredients

##### Base:
**nut butter** - your choice of sunflower, peanut, cashew, etc..
**protein powder** - I use a plain whey protein powder but it's up to you

You could possibly make a protein bar without a nut butter but it helps keep everything in a solid block.
##### Optional:

**Salt** - (for flavor)

**Vanilla/Almond Extract** - for flavor

**Ground Flax Seed** - good source of Omegas

**Honey** -  for sweetness, helps with texture 

**Coconut Oil** - helps make a more solid bar so long as it is cooled, adds flavor )

**Rolled Oats**  - nutrition/fiber, bake them at a low temp separately to make them crispier)

**rice krispies** - more satisfying crunch 

**granola** - more expensive but very easy

**dried fruit** - taste, nutrition, chop into bits

**chocolate** - taste, can be melted and mixed in for more of a fudge like taste or mixed in as is

### Directions
Most varieties of this recipe are no bake.
Simply mix everything together and cool until it solid.

Start with mixing your wet ingredients(nut butters, oils, etc.) then mix in your dry ingredients (protein, oats, fruit, etc. )

You can heat your wet ingredients to make them easier to mix.

##### Tips
Too much protein powder gives a more gritty texture

I haven't tested this yet.
Might need to be baked at a low temp to form a solid bar.
