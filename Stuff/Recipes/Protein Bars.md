### Ingredients

##### Base:
**nut butter** - your choice of sunflower, peanut, cashew, etc..
**protein powder** - I use a plain whey protein powder but it's up to you

You could possibly make a protein bar without a nut butter but it helps keep everything in a solid block.
##### Optional:

**Salt** - (for flavor)

**Vanilla/Almond Extract** - for flavor

**Ground Flax Seed** - good source of Omegas

**Honey** -  for sweetness, helps with texture 

**Coconut Oil** - adds moisture

**Rolled Oats**  - nutrition/fiber, bake them at a low temp separately to make them crispier)

**rice krispies** - more satisfying crunch 

**granola** - more expensive but very easy

**dried fruit** - taste, nutrition, chop into bits

**chocolate** - taste, can be melted and mixed in for more of a fudge like taste or mixed in as is

**Cinnamon** - flavor

**Oat/Almond Flour** - Most other flours cannot be eaten raw like these two.

**banana/pumpkin** -


### Directions
Most varieties of this recipe are no bake.
Simply mix everything together and cool until it solid.

Start with mixing your wet ingredients(nut butters, oils, etc.) then mix in your dry ingredients (protein, oats, fruit, etc. )

You can heat your wet ingredients to make them easier to mix.

Spread in pan or roll into balls before chilling

##### Tips
mixed ingredients should have a consistency similar to cookie dough

Too much protein powder gives a more gritty texture

Coconut Oil makes a more moist bar but has the issue of the bar melting more easily

There are a ton of variations so I'm slowly testing things out. I'll update this as I find things I like as well as more exact ingredient ratios.
