### Introduction
I'm writing this series to improve my own understanding and skills.

I've tried writing this with the assumption you have no prior knowledge while also being detailed enough to serve as a reference or guide. 

**Goal for how things are structured:** Give general picture/overview of all the information then go into greater detail on each individual piece.



example code will be labeled as such
```cpp
int someFunction() {
cout << "some output";
} 
```
and output when relevant will be
```
some output
```
