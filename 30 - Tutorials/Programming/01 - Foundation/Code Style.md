Code Style is everything from indenting lines using tabs or 'x' number of spaces. To how are variables and classes named.

This can be somewhat be a personal choice (unless you work for or with someone else).

The key point is to be consistent!


Some things to note.

Variable names: 
	Avoid overly short or overly long names. 
	-exceptions for common practices like using common iterators like (i, j, m, n,...) or position variables like (x, y, z) etc. 
	-take the context in account
	-variables should generally describe what they are

Document your code while you are writing it.

Code is often much easier to understand while you are writing it. Be kind to your future self and add comments and clear variable names.
