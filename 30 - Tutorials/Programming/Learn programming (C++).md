### Introduction

I'm writing this series with the assumption that you know little if anything about programming. 

I try to go more in depth with good practices and things to watch out for.
I won't be covering absolutely everything but enough that this series can serve as a good reference.

If you notice any mistakes feel free to [contact me](Contact.md) 

example code will be labeled as such
```cpp 
int someFunction(){
cout << "some output";
} 
```
and output when relevant will be
```
some output
```

I will try to include programming exercises with drivers and 
output files to compare to.
