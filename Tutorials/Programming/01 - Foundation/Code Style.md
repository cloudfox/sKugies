Code Style is everything from indenting lines using tabs or 'x' number of spaces. To how are variables and classes named.

This can be somewhat be a personal choice (unless you work for or with someone else).

The key point is to be consistent!


Some things to note.

Variable names: 
	Avoid overly short or overly long names. 
	-exceptions for common practices like using common iterators like (i, j, m, n,...) or position variables like (x, y, z) etc. 
	-take the context in account
	-variables should generally describe what they are

Loops often use single letter variables but that is generally fairly clear. Again use the context to decide if a more specific name is needed for better clarity.
