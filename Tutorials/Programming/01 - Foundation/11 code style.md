Code style is largely a personal choice.

The keypoint is to be consistent.

Good Practices:

Variable names: 
	Avoid overly short or overly long names. 
	-exceptions for common practices like using i, j, x, y, z etc in loops 
	-take the context in account
	-variables should generally describe what they are
