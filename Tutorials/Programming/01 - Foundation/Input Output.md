#### Writing to Console

We've already been using [printf](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) and cout a fair bit.

printf directs its output to the [stdout](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/stdout/) stream which by default is then directed to the console. stdout can be directed to go to other streams.

Some other notable standard streams are 
cerr - error stream
clog - logging stream
These can be redirected to different files but we'll be ignoring that for now.
