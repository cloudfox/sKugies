Before we go onto more advanced topics I'd like to stop for just a bit and go over some of the high level topics of software engineering.

Programming paradigms are simply put ways code can be organized. Some programming languages naturally trend towards certain paradigm than others.

I'd recommend looking at wikipedia for some of the more common ones https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm 

There's much debate over which one is best with no clear winner as far as I can tell. There are pros and cons to each and most arguments against any one seem to boil down to a poor implementation or difficulty doing correctly.
