#tutorial


\*This is very much a work in progress



I'm writing this series with the assumption that you know little if anything about programming. The series will focus on C++ but many of the concepts do carry over to other languages.

I endeavor to give a more broad overview of things before building upon specific topics.

example code will be labeled as such
``` c++
int someFunction(){
cout << "some output";
}
```
and output when relevant will be
```
some output
```

I will try to include programming exercises with drivers and 
output files to compare to.


***Getting Started***
If you are completely new to programming then you will need something to program and later compile your code.

You could use notepad if you like pain and suffering but I'd at least use [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'd then need to separately compile the code.

For simplicity you could alternatively use an IDE like: [vsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/)or any of the thousand others.

To quickly get started https://www.onlinegdb.com/ works just as well.
